# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Change the application currency from US Dollar ($) to Indian Rupee (₹).

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all dollar sign ($) symbols with Indian Rupee symbol (₹) throughout the frontend
- Update backend data models to store and return prices in INR
- Update price input fields and displays across all pages (ProfilePage, CreateBookingPage, BookingDetailPage, DiscoveryPage) to show ₹ symbol and use INR formatting

**User-visible outcome:** All prices throughout the application display in Indian Rupees (₹) instead of US Dollars ($), with appropriate INR formatting.
