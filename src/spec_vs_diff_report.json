  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements: frontend currency symbol replacement (REQ-61), backend data model update (REQ-62), and price field formatting (REQ-63). The backend migration module ensures data preservation, and all key pages display INR symbols with proper formatting.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states 'Preserve existing booking and profile data structures' as a constraint, and 'Historical price migration or data conversion' as a non-goal. The migration.mo file implements price data conversion logic, which contradicts these specifications.",
