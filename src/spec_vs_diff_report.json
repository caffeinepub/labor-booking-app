  "summary": "The implementation provides a comprehensive labor booking platform with Motoko backend and React/TypeScript frontend. All core requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-9) are implemented, including backend data models, booking system, neighbor discovery, Internet Identity authentication, profile management, discovery interface, booking creation, bookings dashboard, and warm earth-tone visual design. However, the required hero background and handshake icon images are referenced but not actually generated in the diff.",
